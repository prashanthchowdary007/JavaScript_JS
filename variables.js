/* 
Variables in JavaScript :

In javascript most of the time we work with data, the "Variable" -> is a "named storage"
which means we store the data in our own naming convention 

*/

// => => to use the Variable in the javascrit use the "let" keyword

let name = "Hello, World!";
console.log(name) 

// (or)

let message;
message = "hi, bob it is good to see you!";
console.log(message)

//output :  "Hello, World!"
